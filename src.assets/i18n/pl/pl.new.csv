Now that you have descended the final flight of stairs from this episode you have a few options ahead of you. You can strive to Master or even Post-Master this hold! To do that you will need to clear all the secret rooms and find the master wall. You will now be able to see the number of secrets in each level on Restore screen to aid you in your hunt. Remember that you only ever need to clear each secret room once ever - there is no need to do it all in one save. Clear them all and the master wall will drop. <p> </p>
Or you can go back to the title screen, chose ""Change Episode"" and play a different hold. Or go to Caravel Games website and buy any of the commercial releases, download a demo to play other people's holds... So many options! <p> </p> <p> </p>
Before I leave you to bask in glory I'd like to send a shout out to some people who made this game possible: <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

ui.yml,ui.help.description,"DROD was conceived by Erik Hermansen back in the '90s. It is largely known as a puzzle game in which you run around rooms in a dungeon, slaying monsters with a Really Big Sword. How does this work?  You will see for yourself as soon as you get around to playing the game.

  Flash DROD is a port of the original DROD game. It uses the media found in the newer DROD game engines that you can download to play on your computer from CaravelGames.com.

Thanks to integrated CaravelNet capabilities, besides just completing the puzzles, players can compete with each other for high scores by completing each room in the fewest moves possible."

  Your objective is to clear each level of King Dugan's Dungeon of monsters. This feat can be accomplished using only your Really Big Sword™ and your wits. Each room is a separate area that has to be cleared in a single session. Should you leave a room without completely clearing it, it will be restored to its initial state when you return."
ui.yml,ui.help.backstory.page_1.width,550
ui.yml,ui.help.backstory.page_1.body,"Beethro Budkin strolled into the Grand Dining Chamber where King Dugan was finishing his massive morning meal.

  ""Away, foul commoner! You disrupt my digestion with your poor hygiene!"" bellowed the King, with bits of pork and potatoes erupting from his mouth.

  ""But sir,"" protested Beethro, ""you sent for me.""

  The expression on the King's large face changed from anger to confusion to recognition to geniality in the space of two seconds.

  ""I really should have had you come in sooner,"" said King Dugan. ""It's unbelievable! You let your guards eat their meals down in the dungeon, they spread crumbs all over the place, and all of a sudden the place is just swarming with giant cockroaches, not to mention goblins, serpents, evil eyes, and other nasty things. It's really gotten out of hand.""

  Beethro straightened with pride. ""Not to fear. I am a trained professional from a long line of dungeon exterminators. I combine five generations of passed-down knowledge with the most state-of-the-art equipment to offer efficient extermination service at an affordable price.""

  ""What kind of equipment do you use?""

  ""I've got a really big sword."""
ui.yml,ui.help.backstory.page_2.width,550
ui.yml,ui.help.backstory.page_2.body,"""Good! When can you start?""

  ""As soon as we handle the details of payment. Here are my standard extermination fees. Just sign at the bottom."" Beethro handed a contract to the King.

  ""These prices are outrageous! Is the privilege of honorable service to the Crown worth nothing these days?""

  ""I can leave.""

  ""No, no, no. We need that dungeon cleared so that the prisoners can receive their torture in a clean and safe environment.""

  ""Well, I'll give you a discount if you'll throw in a princess.""

  ""You're ugly and you smell bad. None of my daughters will have you!""

  Beethro shrugged. ""Fair enough.""

  The King signed at the bottom of the contract. ""Right then. Let me show you to the entrance."""
ui.yml,ui.help.backstory.page_3.width,550
ui.yml,ui.help.backstory.page_3.body,"As he descended, Beethro reflected on the job he had taken. Dugan's Dungeon was exceptionally large and, going by the reports of past exterminators, ridiculously well suited to infestation. It had also been secretly expanded several times, to the dismay of the first person to clear it out, whose contract hadn't covered the possibility. (He'd only gotten paid for the parts he'd known about.)

  Some said sinister forces were behind the expansion. The legend went that a king of past grew tired of his annoying young son and jokingly suggested that the lad go play in the castle dungeons. Taking his father seriously, the boy wandered deep into the dungeon chambers and was never found again. It was said that he did not perish, but lived the rest of his life in the dungeons by preference; that becoming a master of his new habitat, he learned all of the secrets of the underground world and formed alliances with the monsters that dwelt there, setting them to work creating new passageways and breeding better specimens of monster. He named himself the 'Neather, and schemed to rise from the dungeons to claim the throne when his powers were able."
ui.yml,ui.help.backstory.page_4.width,550
ui.yml,ui.help.backstory.page_4.body,"Beethro wasn't sure about all that. For starters, the royal throne wasn't what it had been, now that its power was mostly transferred to a parliament. Never mind the question of who would want to live underground, or how they'd befriend the creatures there, who weren't great conversationalists. But it was true that dungeons tended to be unnecessarily complicated and easily infested, and even sometimes grow without warning - no Dungeon Architect would say why, as a matter of honor - and this more than anything was what kept men like Beethro in work.

  Anyway, an exterminator had plenty of more practical concerns, like the prolific and man-sized dungeon roach. The important thing in Beethro's mind was that he ought to make enough money and dead monsters on this job to finally retire from this thankless trade and open a restaurant.

ui.yml,ui.help.history.body,"""Deadly Rooms of Death"", now almost exclusively called DROD, was created by Erik Hermansen in the 90s. Initially released as a shareware title by Webfoot, later Erik got permission to release it on his own which ultimately led to release DROD: Architect's Edition which featured a level editor.

  The game had multiple sequels which expanded the number of elements in the game as well as lore: Journey to Rooted Hold (2005), The City Beneath (2007), Gunthro and the Epic Blunder (2012) and The Second Sky (2014). Tendry's Tale (2008) is a spinoff that features an RPG-like experience, usually called ""Tower of the Sorcerer""-like. Beyond that multiple Smitemaster's Selections were released - official, canon holds that expand the lore.

  The history of this release starts in late 2011 when Maurycy Zarzycki first mailed Mike Rimer (current owner of the DROD IP) with a proof of concept showing that Flash is capable of supporting what he considered to be the most computationally-intensive part of DROD - pathfinding. At some point a decision was made to release the game in 6 episodes. Ultimately only 4 of those were released - first in 2012, last in 2014.

  The idea to port this project to JavaScript started in mid 2021, continued a little in early 2022 and then, finally, it was finished and open sourced in mid 2025."
