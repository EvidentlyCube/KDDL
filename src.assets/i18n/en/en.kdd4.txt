# Level Entrances
# -- OLD PARTIALLY
entrTut=Beethro Budkin, fifth-generation professional dungeon exterminator, was hired by King Dugan to clear the king's multi-level dungeon of a large monster infestation.///
    Beethro charges by the room, and as a professional, he is contract-bound to clear all the monsters from each and every room in the dungeon to get paid.///
    The only weapon Beethro needs to do his job is a Really Big Sword, which will defeat almost any monster in a single hit.
entr13="I probably ought to have skipped past this level, but a contract is a contract.  Where'd I put those bread crumbs?" -Beethro
entr14=On this level, you'll finally meet some folks with a healthy respect for your blade.
entr15=This level is like the time you mowed the lawn and had exactly the amount of gas needed to finish, but then you screwed up, and had to go buy some more gas.  And there was a big serpent at the gas station, and you wanted to go in to pay the attendant, but the front door was locked, so you drank a mimic potion to get in, and then the roaches...\n\nWell, I guess the metaphor breaks down.
entr16=These roaches need an authority figure to guide them.  Someone with charisma and character.  Someone like you!
# -- OLD
entrMaster=Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...////
    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
entrMasterBack=Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entrOriginal13Enter=Beethro descended into the mystical set of deadly, pointless corridors.
entrOriginal13Success=Proud of his achievement, but a whole lot less sane, Beethro emerged from the infamous 13th level of King Dugan's Dungeon.
entrOriginal13Escape=Beethro ran away from the challenge like a little, scrawny kitten.

# Speeches
sp_14_1E=Ahh...nothing satisfies like the sweet sight of no tar at all!
sp_14_2N2E_1=Bah...looks like I need to keep this goblin alive long enough to remove that serpent up there for me.
sp_14_2N2E_2=No helpings from me!  You cuts me up, I know it--don't matter now or later.
sp_14_2N2E_3=Don't act all brave.  Because I know goblins aren't brave.
sp_14_2N2E_4=No, No, No!  Keeps pointy thing away!
sp_14_2N2E_5=You're thinking you'll sneak behind when I'm not looking.  Yeah.
sp_14_2N2E_6=Mercy!
sp_14_2N2E_7=Look, you'd do the same in my place!
sp_14_2N2E_8=That's nasty business. Hope I don't have to do that again!
sp_14_2N2E_9=Rest there a bit while I open the passage, goblin.
sp_14_2N2E_10=(I probably didn't need to lock him up there...but better safe than sorry!)
sp_14_1N1E=Look at that...not a single wall destroyed!

sp_o13_1=Here, roachie, roachie...

# Tutorial:

sp_tut_entr_1=Welcome to DROD.
sp_tut_entr_2=If this is your first time playing a game in the series, please continue east.
sp_tut_entr_3=There you'll find a couple of easier puzzles to get yourself introduced to the concept.
sp_tut_entr_4=Take the stairs if you're familiar with the game.
sp_tut_entr_5=Use numerical keyboard or keys 789 uio jkl to move around.
sp_tut_entr_6=Keys can be changed from the options menu which you can access by hitting `escape`.
sp_tut_1E_1=Orbs affect yellow doors. Hit it with your sword to activate it.
sp_tut_1E_2=Click an orb with your mouse to see which doors it affects.
sp_tut_1E_3=Rotate your sword using keys `Q` and `W`.
sp_tut_1E_4=Hit the roach with your sword to kill it.
sp_tut_1E_5=Hit the orb and wait for a couple of turns to see how monsters behave when diagonally approaching a corner.
sp_tut_1E_6=Wait for it...
sp_tut_1E_7=As you can see, when approaching a corner diagonally, monsters prefer vertical movement.
sp_tut_1E_8=Kill the roaches to drop the green door and follow East.
sp_tut_2E_1=You'll learn the backswipe here. After hitting the orb, there is only one way to kill the roaches - move directly North West or South West.
sp_tut_2E_2=You might want to repeat it a couple of times to help you remember it, as it is a very important technique.
sp_tut_2E_3=You can move diagonally even through very narrow passages.
sp_tut_2E_4=Broken and secret walls can be destroyed with your sword.
sp_tut_2E_5=Arrows block movement of all entities against the direction they face
sp_tut_2E_6=Step on the checkpoint to restore here if you die.
sp_tut_2E_7=Roach queens lay eggs every 30 turns. Use the spawn timer on the left side of the game screen to know when the next spawn will happen.
sp_tut_3E_1=Evil Eyes remain dormant unless you stop in their line of sight - once awakened, they'll attack you like roaches.
sp_tut_3E_2=Serpents cannot be damaged by your sword. The only way to kill them is to place them in a dead end.
sp_tut_3E_3=Use the broken walls to forge a dead end for the serpents.
sp_tut_3E_4=You can use backspace to undo a move.
sp_tut_3E_5=Serpents, unlike other monsters, cannot move diagonally.
sp_tut_3E_6=At any given moment they have a movement preference which changes every five turns.
sp_tut_3E_7=You can see their current movement preference under the spawn timer.
sp_tut_4E_1=When you step off a trapdoor, it will fall down, leaving a pit behind.
sp_tut_4E_2=To open the red gate, you will need to drop all the trapdoors.
sp_tut_4E_3=Remember that you can use the pits left behind by dropped trapdoors to shield yourself against roaches.
sp_tut_5E_1=Tar is a very peculiar substance. It can only be damaged on flat edges.
sp_tut_5E_2=You do not need to clear all of it to conquer a room.
sp_tut_6E_1=Tar mothers are fearsome enemies. Despite staying in one place, hidden in tar, they make tar grow every 30 turns.
sp_tut_6E_2=The black door won't open until you clear all the tar from a room.
sp_tut_7E_1=Drinking this potion will allow you to place a mimic.
sp_tut_7E_2=Mimics will repeat all your moves and can drop trapdoors just like Beethro.
sp_tut_8E_1=When you drink the invisibility potion, monsters won't move unless they are in the smell range.
sp_tut_8E_2=Don't let the roach queen escape onto the arrows or you won't be able to kill her.
sp_tut_8E_3=You did well, congratulations!
sp_tut_8E_4=It seems you have failed.
sp_tut_8E_5=You can use "R" to restart the room or wait to hear some hints.
sp_tut_8E_6=...
sp_tut_8E_7=There are three different ways to solve this room.
sp_tut_8E_8=The fastest one requires you trap the queen on arrows near the green door in such a way, that you can kill it by stepping on or next to the diagonal arrow.
sp_tut_8E_9=The other one, nearly as quick the previous can be achieved by walking horizontally towards the queen so that the green door blocks it.
sp_tut_8E_10=The last one requires full circle around the room and trapping the queen in the room entrance corridor.
sp_tut_8E_11=If you still can't do this, wait a couple of turns for the emergency mimic potion to open.
sp_tut_9E=Good luck!

sc_tut_emergency_potion=Emergency mimic potion, use if room is too difficult.
sc_tut_tricky=This tricky room is not required

# As Beethro descended yet another set of stairs, he decided that he wasnt be paid nearly enough for this nonsense. Something was horribly wrong. Clear out King Dugans Dungeon. Bah! What a bunch of hooey!
# The further he delved into the depths of this labyrinth, the less sense everything made. The walls looked funny. Where was the mold!? The dust!? It was cleaner down here than some of the first few floors. He could see his face in the floor and, all things considered, thats never pleasant.
# He was no longer certain he was actually cleaning out King Dugans personal property.
# But until he had some answers well, a jobs a job!

outro=The last four floors were a real pain for Beethro with the tar, the doors, the roaches... As he descended the stairs he smelled more of the blue goo which made him cringe but in the very far back of his head something told him that there is even worse danger ahead of him...////
