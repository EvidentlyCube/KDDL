# Entrances

entrance.lvl_1.entrance.13x12: >
    Beethro pulled out the three bottles again (10-cups full, 2-cups empty,
    5-cups empty). "How am I going to get my four-cup swig?" He poured from the
    first into the second. He poured from the second into the third. He poured
    from the first into the second. He poured from the second into the third,
    but accidentally spilled a cup. With a sigh, he poured the remaining leaf
    juice back into the first bottle.


    Beethro was going to start again, but then he noticed he was surrounded on
    all sides by living tar! It had grown around him during the drink
    preparation. "By Munbo! Can't a fellow settle down for just a moment?"
entrance.lvl_2.entrance.13x11: >
    In Beethro's world, the number "18" is considered unlucky. Most dungeons
    are built without an eighteenth level. Of course, all levels of a dungeon
    are fairly unlucky to begin with, so maybe it doesn't matter that much.
entrance.lvl_3.entrance.13x12: |
    "I've got that toasty 72-percent-done feeling. What's next?"
    -Beethro
entrance.lvl_4.1w.20x10: >
    Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entrance.lvl_4.entrance.10x12: >
    You know, if these monsters were just a little more organized, you'd have
    no chance against them. Frightening, if you think about it.
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.12x19: >
    Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...

    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.

scroll.lvl_1.1s1e.3x3: A lot of good it does you here!
scroll.lvl_1.entrance.6x5: This level requires a great deal of efficiency.
scroll.lvl_2.2e.0x12: |
    Five serpents,
    four mimics.

    How hard can this be?

speech.10025259: A giant brain you may be, but in the end you're just another pest to mop up.


# Outro

outro: >
    Those brains were a real pain but Beethro, being a professional smitemaster,
    can handle anything without breaking a sweat. But what about this strange
    feeling that something much scarier lurks ahead of him?
