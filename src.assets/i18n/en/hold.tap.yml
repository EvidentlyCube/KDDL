# Entrances

entrance.lvl_1.entrance.13x10: >
    Beethro had heard that a vault containing valuable treasures lay within the
    underground chambers of a long deserted palace.


    Mostly the palace was over-run with roaches and contaminated with tarstuff,
    but there were rumours that some of the original defences still remained.


    Maybe Beethro could find a secret way in...


    [Author's note: 1N1W inspired by a similar room in Nightmare Dungeon by Doom]
entrance.lvl_1.entrance.13x7: Beethro returned from the Tutorial Level
entrance.lvl_2.entrance.13x8: >
    Beethro could not believe his eyes.


    Clearly the palace had resisted any invasion by the vermin that littered
    the upper floors.


    Vast marble hallways stretched out in all directions, lined by bizarre statues.


    However, a contingent of evil eyes remained on watch for intruders.
entrance.lvl_3.entrance.7x7: >
    As Beethro descended the air became colder and colder.


    Perhaps the previous owners kept a wine cellar down here?


    When Beethro reached the bottom of the stairs he was met with an even more astonishing sight.
entrance.lvl_4.entrance.13x17: >
    Beethro continued to descend.


    He entered a complex of twisting tunnels and lost his way.

    After descending another set of stairs he came out well beneath the palace
    in the sewer system. Clearly he'd gone too far down and would have to
    retrace his steps.


    Unfortunately, the door to the stairwell slammed shut behind him.
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.13x17: |
    Beethro stumbled upon a long-buried crypt, since forgotten about.

    What secrets would he find within?
entrance.lvl_6.entrance.13x12: |
    Beethro finally reached the underground vaults.

    A team of goblins and swarm of serpents still remained, guarding the treasure...

    [Author's Note: 1N1E and 1S1E are inspired by similar rooms by Tim from the hold Advanced Concepts]
entrance.lvl_7.entrance.2x12: >
    Here is a quick tutorial demonstrating most of the elements you will see in
    this, and other, holds and how they work.


# Scrolls

scroll.lvl_1.entrance.13x6: Head up these stairs to go to a tutorial section.
scroll.lvl_4.1n2w.23x17: Orbs in the bottom section each toggle the corresponding door in the top section.
scroll.lvl_4.1n2w.23x18: This room is not required in order to exit this level but is required to drop the blue door.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.13x2: The diagonal line of crumbly walls continues through the tar.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.9x13: |
    Required rooms show up red on the minimap.
    Unrequired rooms are pink.
    Cleared rooms are white.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.9x11: Blue doors drop when all required rooms on a level are cleared.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.18x14: |
    Snakes can't be killed with your sword, but only by being trapped in a dead end.

    They cannot move diagonally or over force arrows or scrolls.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.1x12: Exit
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.4x12: |
    These are force arrows.

    You cannot move across them counter to the direction they are pointing.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.7x12: |
    Click on each orb to see what it does.

    Red: Closes yellow door

    Green: Opens yellow door

    Amber: Toggles yellow door between open and closed
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.14x12: Crumbly walls can be destroyed with your sword
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.12x5: |
    Tar can be cut at its edges, but not at its corners.

    If the width of a block of tar is reduced to 1 tile, tar babies are produced.

    They move like roaches
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.18x6: >
    Goblins are smarter than roaches - they can dodge around obstacles to get
    to you and run away from your sword.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.16x12: |
    The objective of each room is to clear all the monsters and exit.

    When you clear all monsters, the green door will open.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.4x19: Roach queens always run away from you
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.8x8: >
    Roaches move directly towards you but can be blocked vertically or
    horizontally by walls or obstacles.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.10x16: |
    If you walk over a trapdoor, it will drop, revealing pit beneath which you cannot walk over.

    If you drop all the trapdoors in a room, the red doors will drop.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.14x16: |
    Wraithwings can fly over pits.

    Lone wraithwings always try  to stay 5 tiles away from you.

    Multiple wraithwings can be more brave and can move towards you and attack.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.16x17: |
    Eyes do not move until you walk into their line of sight.

    Then they wake up and move towards you as a roach does.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.19x19: >
    Stepping on a mimic potion allows you to place a mimic anywhere in the room
    (move with your mouse or direction keys, click or press "wait" to place).


    Mimics will copy your every move.


    Hint: Place in the chamber to the right.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.19x8: Invisibility potions make you invisible to all monsters outside of a 5x5 square around you.
scroll.lvl_7.entrance.19x12: Stepping on a second invisibility potion reverses the effect of the first.
scroll.lvl_7.1e.4x12: If there is no way of getting to you that the brain can see, the monsters will move normally.
scroll.lvl_7.1e.16x20: Note that mimics cannot be placed on arrows, trapdoors, scrolls or yellow doors.
scroll.lvl_7.1e.7x17: |
    Roach queens lay roach eggs every 30 turns.
    They cannot lay eggs over trapdoors, scrolls, arrows or yellow doors (open or closed)

    Roach eggs hatch into roaches.
scroll.lvl_7.1e.7x7: |
    Roach queens lay roach eggs every 30 turns.
    They cannot lay eggs over trapdoors, scrolls, arrows or yellow doors (open or closed)

    Roach eggs hatch into roaches after 5 turns.
scroll.lvl_7.1e.6x12: |
    The eyes in the tar are tar mothers.

    A tar mother in the room causes the tar to expand every 30 turns. Tar does not expand over arrows or scrolls.

    If tar expands into a one tile wide gap, a tar baby is formed..
scroll.lvl_7.1e.2x12: >
    The red monster in the centre of the room is a brain.


    They don't move and can't kill you, but if there's one in the room, all the
    other monsters can form a path to you and move around obstacles to get to you.
scroll.lvl_7.1e.14x17: Brains don't direct monsters over arrows or scrolls
scroll.lvl_7.1e.14x7: Brains don't direct monsters over arrows or scrolls
scroll.lvl_7.1e.20x19: SCROLL
scroll.lvl_7.1e.19x20: SCROLL
scroll.lvl_7.1e.16x4: Note that mimics cannot be placed on arrows, trapdoors, scrolls or yellow doors.
