# Level Entrances
entr17=Beethro pulled out the three bottles again (10-cups full, 2-cups empty, 5-cups empty). //
    "How am I going to get my four-cup swig?" He poured from the first into the second. //
    He poured from the second into the third. He poured from the first into the second. //
    He poured from the second into the third, but accidentally spilled a cup. //
    With a sigh, he poured the remaining leaf juice back into the first bottle.////
///
Beethro was going to start again, but then he noticed he was surrounded on all //
sides by living tar!  It had grown around him during the drink preparation. //
"By Munbo!  Can't a fellow settle down for just a moment?"
entr18=In Beethro's world, the number "18" is considered unlucky.  Most dungeons are built without an eighteenth level. //
Of course, all levels of a dungeon are fairly unlucky to begin with, so maybe it doesn't matter that much.
entr19="I've got that toasty 72-percent-done feeling.  What's next?"///
-Beethro
entr20=You know, if these monsters were just a little more organized, you'd have no chance against them.  Frightening, if you think about it.
entrMaster=Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...////
    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
entrMasterBack=Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
