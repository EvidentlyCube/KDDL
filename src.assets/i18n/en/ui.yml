# Help & Backstory

ui.help.description.width: 450
ui.help.description: >
    \tDROD was conceived by Erik Hermansen back in the '90s. It is largely known as
    a puzzle game in which you run around rooms in a dungeon, slaying monsters with
    a Really Big Sword. How does this work?  You will see for yourself as soon as
    you get around to playing the game.


    \tFlash DROD is a port of the original DROD game. It uses the media found in the
    newer DROD game engines that you can download to play on your computer from
    CaravelGames.com.


    Thanks to integrated CaravelNet capabilities, besides just completing the
    puzzles, players can compete with each other for high scores by completing each
    room in the fewest moves possible.

    \tYour objective is to clear each level of King Dugan's Dungeon of monsters. This feat can \
    be accomplished using only your Really Big Swordâ„¢ and your wits. Each room is a separate \
    area that has to be cleared in a single session. Should you leave a room without completely \
    clearing it, it will be restored to its initial state when you return.

    \tBeethro Budkin strolled into the Grand Dining Chamber where King Dugan
    was finishing his massive morning meal.


    \t"Away, foul commoner! You disrupt my digestion with your poor hygiene!"
    bellowed the King, with bits of pork and potatoes erupting from his mouth.


    \t"But sir," protested Beethro, "you sent for me."


    \tThe expression on the King's large face changed from anger to confusion
    to recognition to geniality in the space of two seconds.


    \t"I really should have had you come in sooner," said King Dugan. "It's
    unbelievable! You let your guards eat their meals down in the dungeon,
    they spread crumbs all over the place, and all of a sudden the place is
    just swarming with giant cockroaches, not to mention goblins, serpents,
    evil eyes, and other nasty things. It's really gotten out of hand."


    \tBeethro straightened with pride. "Not to fear. I am a trained
    professional from a long line of dungeon exterminators. I combine five
    generations of passed-down knowledge with the most state-of-the-art
    equipment to offer efficient extermination service at an affordable price."


    \t"What kind of equipment do you use?"


    \t"I've got a really big sword."
ui.help.backstory.page_2.width: 550
ui.help.backstory.page_2.body: >
    \t"Good! When can you start?"


    \t"As soon as we handle the details of payment. Here are my standard
    extermination fees. Just sign at the bottom." Beethro handed a
    contract to the King.


    \t"These prices are outrageous! Is the privilege of honorable service to the
    Crown worth nothing these days?"


    \t"I can leave."


    \t"No, no, no. We need that dungeon cleared so that the prisoners can
    receive their torture in a clean and safe environment."


    \t"Well, I'll give you a discount if you'll throw in a princess."


    \t"You're ugly and you smell bad. None of my daughters will have you!"


    \tBeethro shrugged. "Fair enough."


    \tThe King signed at the bottom of the contract. "Right then. Let me show you to the entrance."
ui.help.backstory.page_3.width: 550
ui.help.backstory.page_3.body: >
    \tAs he descended, Beethro reflected on the job he had taken. Dugan's
    Dungeon was exceptionally large and, going by the reports of past
    exterminators, ridiculously well suited to infestation. It had also been
    secretly expanded several times, to the dismay of the first person to clear
    it out, whose contract hadn't covered the possibility. (He'd only gotten
    paid for the parts he'd known about.)


    \tSome said sinister forces were behind the expansion. The legend went that
    a king of past grew tired of his annoying young son and jokingly suggested
    that the lad go play in the castle dungeons. Taking his father seriously,
    the boy wandered deep into the dungeon chambers and was never found again.
    It was said that he did not perish, but lived the rest of his life in the
    dungeons by preference; that becoming a master of his new habitat, he
    learned all of the secrets of the underground world and formed alliances
    with the monsters that dwelt there, setting them to work creating new
    passageways and breeding better specimens of monster. He named himself the
    'Neather, and schemed to rise from the dungeons to claim the throne when
    his powers were able.
ui.help.backstory.page_4.width: 550
ui.help.backstory.page_4.body: >
    \tBeethro wasn't sure about all that. For starters, the royal throne wasn't
    what it had been, now that its power was mostly transferred to a parliament.
    Never mind the question of who would want to live underground, or how they'd
    befriend the creatures there, who weren't great conversationalists. But it
    was true that dungeons tended to be unnecessarily complicated and easily
    infested, and even sometimes grow without warning - no Dungeon Architect
    would say why, as a matter of honor - and this more than anything was what
    kept men like Beethro in work.


    \tAnyway, an exterminator had plenty of more practical concerns, like the
    prolific and man-sized dungeon roach. The important thing in Beethro's mind
    was that he ought to make enough money and dead monsters on this job to
    finally retire from this thankless trade and open a restaurant.


    \t"I'll call it 'Beethro's Roasted Roach Grill'!"

ui.help.history.body: >
    \t"Deadly Rooms of Death", now almost exclusively called DROD, was created
    by Erik Hermansen in the 90s. Initially released as a shareware title by
    Webfoot, later Erik got permission to release it on his own which ultimately
    led to release DROD: Architect's Edition which featured a level editor.


    \tThe game had multiple sequels which expanded the number of elements in the
    game as well as lore: Journey to Rooted Hold (2005), The City Beneath
    (2007), Gunthro and the Epic Blunder (2012) and The Second Sky (2014).
    Tendry's Tale (2008) is a spinoff that features an RPG-like experience,
    usually called "Tower of the Sorcerer"-like. Beyond that multiple
    Smitemaster's Selections were released - official, canon holds that expand
    the lore.


    \tThe history of this release starts in late 2011 when Maurycy Zarzycki
    first mailed Mike Rimer (current owner of the DROD IP) with a proof of
    concept showing that Flash is capable of supporting what he considered to
    be the most computationally-intensive part of DROD - pathfinding. At some
    point a decision was made to release the game in 6 episodes. Ultimately
    only 4 of those were released - first in 2012, last in 2014.


    \tThe idea to port this project to JavaScript started in mid 2021, continued
    a little in early 2022 and then, finally, it was finished and open sourced
    in mid 2025.

ui.restore.help.body: >
    Restoring works almost like saves in your favorite video games. The
    difference is that though you cannot save whenever you wish as the game
    autosaves when entering any unconquered room.


    To restore to a previous state, first select a level from the list on the
    left, then choose a room on the minimap below. The minimap will grey out
    rooms which were not yet visited in the save. Those with a white background
    are conquered, those with a red one are not.


    Later you can always load up your best state by clicking the "Select the
    farthest save" button.


    Restore is the most useful if you want to improve your score for a room,
    search for secrets, or simply replay a favorite room.
ui.restore.warning: >
    You have chosen to go back to a previous state - some rooms will be
    restored to their unconquered state.


    You can always restore to your most recent/best state by clicking
    "Select the farthest save".
