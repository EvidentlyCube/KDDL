# Entrances

entrance.lvl_1.entrance.13x12: >
    "I hope this next one doesn't have many critters. The hands are starting to
    blister from all this hacking." -Beethro
entrance.lvl_2.entrance.10x11: >
    Question: You are starving to death, with no hope to find food in time. But
    you do have a mimic potion. Would you make a mimic, kill the mimic, and eat
    an exact copy of yourself to survive?


    These are the kinds of questions a dungeon exterminator must answer every working day of his life.
entrance.lvl_3.entrance.14x22: |
    You're probably the sort that uses people when it's convenient, and gets \
    rid of them afterward.

    I bet you are.

    We'll see!
entrance.lvl_4.entrance.11x9: >
    "Wow, I didn't expect to find a whole city down here. Good deal! Maybe
    they've got a restroom somewhere." -Beethro
entrance.lvl_5.2n1w.13x13: >
    Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.16x22: >
    "There better not be more than 25 levels to this place. That's plenty big
    enough, and all I'm down for in the contract," said Beethro as he arrived
    on the final level of Dugan's Dungeon. Just a short distance in front of
    him was a small man holding a mallet.


    Beethro called out, "Hey there, little buddy! How'd you end up so deep below?"

    The man shook his mallet angrily and raced off.


    "Hold up! I want to talk to you!" But he didn't stop.
entrance.lvl_6.entrance.18x12: >
    Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...

    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.


# Scrolls

scroll.lvl_4.entrance.12x9: >
    Welcome to the subterranean town of Neatherville. The locals are always glad to have visitors.

scroll.lvl_5.2w.25x22: Stalemate.
scroll.lvl_6.1s.11x6: Well well well. By now you have undoubtedly completed almost everything there is to do - maybe some straggling achievements are left in this or earlier episodes?
scroll.lvl_6.1s.12x7: My most sincere congratulations and I hope you won't stop there.
scroll.lvl_6.1s.13x8: >
    If you haven't yet played other holds bundled in this game I highly
    recommend them. That or maybe grab a copy of DROD: The Second Sky and play

# Outro

outro: >
    The legend goes that a king of past grew tired of his annoying young son and
    jokingly suggested that the lad go play in the castle dungeons. Taking his
    father seriously, the boy wandered deep into the dungeon chambers and was
    never found again.
    <p> </p><p> </p>
    <p> </p><p> </p>

    Was 'Neather that long-lost prince? Is there a way he could have avoided
    killing the curious fellow?
    <p> </p><p> </p>
    <p> </p><p> </p>
    <p> </p><p> </p>

    All Beethro knows is that there was no Twenty-Sixth floor - the final stairs
    ended with a wall. With no convenient elevator in sight he was forced to
    once again traverse the dungeon.
    <p> </p><p> </p>
    <p> </p><p> </p>
    <p> </p><p> </p>

    <font size="32" color="#FFFF00">Congratulations!</font>
    <p> </p><p> </p>
    <p> </p><p> </p>
    <p> </p><p> </p>


    That's the final episode of King Dugan's Dungeon Lite! Beethro did manage
    to retire as a delver and open his Roaster Roach Grill. Not for long though,
    as a number of years later he acquired a portable orb that could open the
    mysterious door on Tenth Level. You can explore that story in DROD: Journey
    to Rooted Hold!
