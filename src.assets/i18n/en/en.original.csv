The only weapon Beethro needs to do his job is a Really Big Sword, which will defeat almost any monster in a single hit.

You have completed the first episode in the Deadly Rooms of Death, King Dugan's Dungeon Lite hold. I sincerely hope you have found this experience enjoyable.
Now that you have descended the final flight of stairs available in this set, you may want to try to Master, and then Post-Master, this game!  To do this, go hunt for secret rooms. The number of secret rooms left on each level is now displayed on the Restore Screen.
Once you manage to conquer them all, a special Mastery Area will be opened. Can you find out how to access it?
You may also wish to play the next episode in the DROD:KDDL series.

You have completed the second episode in the Deadly Rooms of Death, King Dugan's Dungeon Lite hold. I sincerely hope you have found this experience enjoyable.
Now that you have descended the final flight of stairs available in this set, you may want to try to Master, and then Post-Master, this game!  To do this, go hunt for secret rooms. The number of secret rooms left on each level is now displayed on the Restore Screen.
Once you manage to conquer them all, a special Mastery Area will be opened. Can you find out how to access it?
You may also wish to play the next episode in the DROD:KDDL series.

Before I leave you to bask in your feeling of utter glory, I'd like to thank a couple of people, who made it possible for you to play this game:

Beethro charges by the room, and as a professional, he is contract-bound to clear all the monsters from each and every room in the dungeon to get paid.
The only weapon Beethro needs to do his job is a Really Big Sword, which will defeat almost any monster in a single hit.

Beethro sat down on the steps for a break. He pulled three bottles out of his pack. The ten-cup bottle was filled with refreshing leaf juice, and the other two bottles, which were in two-cup and five-cup sizes, were empty. Beethro wanted to drink exactly four cups of leaf juice in one uninterrupted gulp. He started messing around with the cups, pouring juice from one to another and back, but after a while gave up.

<font size=""32"" color=""#FFFF00"">Congratulations!</font>

You have completed the third episode in the Deadly Rooms of Death, King Dugan's Dungeon Lite hold. I sincerely hope you have found this experience enjoyable.
Now that you have descended the final flight of stairs available in this set, you may want to try to Master, and then Post-Master, this game!  To do this, go hunt for secret rooms. The number of secret rooms left on each level is now displayed on the Restore Screen.
Once you manage to conquer them all, a special Mastery Area will be opened. Can you find out how to access it?
You may also wish to play the next episode in the DROD:KDDL series.

Before I leave you to bask in your feeling of utter glory, I'd like to thank a couple of people, who made it possible for you to play this game:

You have completed the fourth episode in the Deadly Rooms of Death, King Dugan's Dungeon Lite series. We sincerely hope you have found this experience enjoyable.
Now that you have descended the final flight of stairs available in this set, you may want to try to Master, and then Post-Master, this game!  To do this, go hunt for secret rooms. The number of secret rooms left on each level is now displayed on the Restore Screen.
Once you manage to conquer them all, a special Mastery Area will be opened. Can you find out how to access it?

<font size=""32"" color=""#FFFF00"">Congratulations!</font>

You have completed the fifth episode in the Deadly Rooms of Death, King Dugan's Dungeon Lite series. We sincerely hope you have found this experience enjoyable.
Now that you have descended the final flight of stairs available in this set, you may want to try to Master, and then Post-Master, this game!  To do this, go hunt for secret rooms. The number of secret rooms left on each level is now displayed on the Restore Screen.
Once you manage to conquer them all, a special Mastery Area will be opened. Can you find out how to access it?
You may also wish to play the next episode in the DROD:KDDL series.

Before we leave you to bask in your feeling of utter glory, we'd like to thank a couple of people, who made it possible for you to play this game:

  Flash DROD is a port of the original DROD game. It uses the media found in the newer DROD game engines that you can download to play on your computer from CaravelGames.com.

en.txt,backstory1,"  Beethro Budkin strolled into the Grand Dining Chamber where King Dugan was finishing his massive morning meal.

  ""Away, foul commoner! You disrupt my digestion with your poor hygiene!"" bellowed the King, with bits of pork and potatoes erupting from his mouth.

  ""But sir,"" protested Beethro, ""you sent for me.""

  The expression on the King's large face changed from anger to confusion to recognition to geniality in the space of two seconds.

  ""I really should have had you come in sooner,"" said King Dugan. ""It's unbelievable! You let your guards eat their meals down in the dungeon, they spread crumbs all over the place, and all of a sudden the place is just swarming with giant cockroaches, not to mention goblins, serpents, evil eyes, and other nasty things. It's really gotten out of hand.""

  Beethro straightened with pride. ""Not to fear. I am a trained professional from a long line of dungeon exterminators. I combine five generations of passed-down knowledge with the most state-of-the-art equipment to offer efficient extermination service at an affordable price.""

  ""What kind of equipment do you use?""

  ""I've got a really big sword."""
en.txt,backstory2,"  ""Good! When can you start?""

  ""As soon as we handle the details of payment. Here are my standard extermination fees. Just sign at the bottom."" Beethro handed a contract to the King.

  ""These prices are outrageous! Is the privilege of honorable service to the Crown worth nothing these days?""

  ""I can leave.""

  ""No, no, no. We need that dungeon cleared so that the prisoners can receive their torture in a clean and safe environment.""

  ""Well, I'll give you a discount if you'll throw in a princess.""

  ""You're ugly and you smell bad. None of my daughters will have you!""

  Beethro shrugged. ""Fair enough.""

  The King signed at the bottom of the contract. ""Right then. Let me show you to the entrance."""
en.txt,backstory3,"  As he descended, Beethro reflected on the job he had taken. Dugan's Dungeon was exceptionally large and, going by the reports of past exterminators, ridiculously well suited to infestation. It had also been secretly expanded several times, to the dismay of the first person to clear it out, whose contract hadn't covered the possibility. (He'd only gotten paid for the parts he'd known about.)

  Some said sinister forces were behind the expansion. The legend went that a king of past grew tired of his annoying young son and jokingly suggested that the lad go play in the castle dungeons. Taking his father seriously, the boy wandered deep into the dungeon chambers and was never found again. It was said that he did not perish, but lived the rest of his life in the dungeons by preference; that becoming a master of his new habitat, he learned all of the secrets of the underground world and formed alliances with the monsters that dwelt there, setting them to work creating new passageways and breeding better specimens of monster. He named himself the 'Neather, and schemed to rise from the dungeons to claim the throne when his powers were able."
en.txt,backstory4,"  Beethro wasn't sure about all that. For starters, the royal throne wasn't what it had been, now that its power was mostly transferred to a parliament. Never mind the question of who would want to live underground, or how they'd befriend the creatures there, who weren't great conversationalists. But it was true that dungeons tended to be unnecessarily complicated and easily infested, and even sometimes grow without warning - no Dungeon Architect would say why, as a matter of honor - and this more than anything was what kept men like Beethro in work.

  Anyway, an exterminator had plenty of more practical concerns, like the prolific and man-sized dungeon roach. The important thing in Beethro's mind was that he ought to make enough money and dead monsters on this job to finally retire from this thankless trade and open a restaurant.

  ""I'll call it 'Beethro's Roasted Roach Grill'!"""

en.txt,drodHistory,"  ""Deadly Rooms of Death"" (DROD) was first created by Erik Hermansen in the '90s. The game was released by Webfoot and is known as `Webfoot DROD`, though this game is no longer on sale and can't be legally distributed or obtained. Luckily, Erik was allowed to redevelop the game on his own and so `Caravel DROD` was born in 2002.

  Then, in 2003, ""DROD: Architect's Edition"" was released, featuring a level editor that allowed everyone to create their own `holds` (level sets) and share them publicly on the CaravelGames forum. The game garnered a large fanbase and a plan to create another game was conceived.

  On April 1, 2005, ""DROD: Journey to Rooted Hold"" was released! The list of new features added was amazing. It featured new graphics, in-game scripting, over a dozen new game elements, a captivating story and an antagonist whose voice sent chills down everyone's spine.

  Exactly two years later ""DROD: The City Beneath"" saw the light of the day. That day set a record for the most active users on the Caravel Forum at one time. TCB featured even more new elements and improvements over JtRH, and an increased difficulty level.

  In 2008, ""DROD RPG"" came out. Though not as popular as the mainstream titles, it was still a shining gem. The big difference was that the game was a resource-managing multi-room strategic challenge. Each monster had stats and you had to calculate what monsters could be defeated at a given moment, plan where to go next, which resources to collect, and when and how to get them.

  ""DROD 4: Gunthro and the Epic Blunder"" is the latest installment, released on the 1st of April 2012. This game is aimed at new players, and is much more beginner-friendly because of easier puzzles, more intuitive tutorials and more obvious hub levels."
