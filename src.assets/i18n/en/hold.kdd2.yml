# Entrances

entrance.lvl_1.entrance.13x12: >
    The last level left Beethro sweating. "I guess this is going to be hard
    work after all." Fortunately, there was a cool breeze coming from
    the next level.
entrance.lvl_2.1s1w.21x8: >
    Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entrance.lvl_2.1s1w.4x18: >
    Beethro stumbled up and down a series of poorly-lit staircases. "This is a
    safety hazard and there aren't even any roaches in here! Someone oughta at
    least put a handrail or s-" thought Beethro right before he fell twelve
    flights and knocked himself out for a solid hour. After dreaming horrible,
    horrible dreams about eyeball pudding, Beethro groggily awakened in a room.
    "Gob! Would it be so hard to have these places be on the map for once?"
entrance.lvl_2.entrance.11x15: >
    Perhaps the level architect was trying too hard to make his point, whatever
    that point was. In any case, you can be thankful that there are no other
    levels in Dugan's Dungeon like this one.
entrance.lvl_3.entrance.14x13: >
    As Beethro climbed down the stairs he heard a loud hissing. As a seasoned
    professional, he knew instantly what it was, but was still startled by the
    sheer volume. "Jeebus! How many of those nasty things are down there?"
entrance.lvl_4.entrance.9x9: >
    Some monsters are cunning and lethal, and others are just a horrible pain
    to clean up after.
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.10x18: |
    Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted \
    corridor...

    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
scroll.lvl_1.1n2w.6x7: I hope you left yourself a path back.
scroll.lvl_2.1s1w.10x12: >
    This is a master wall. It won't open until you conquer
    the hold and also all of its secrets.
scroll.lvl_2.3e.3x11: Secret Passageway
scroll.lvl_3.1n.14x2: |
    My tribute to Tron.

    -Erik
scroll.lvl_3.1n.3x2: I didn't think you'd figure that last one out.
scroll.lvl_3.1n.5x23: |
    Okay, I admit it's not EXACTLY the same thing as light cycles.

    -Erik
scroll.lvl_3.2n.13x10: You might find it useful that Shift+Wait waits until the next spawn.
scroll.lvl_3.2n1w.25x15: |
    To the feeble-minded, turn back!  This room can only be completed by a master intellect.
    (This room is not required.)
scroll.lvl_4.1s.18x7: Feel free to play with it a bit.
scroll.lvl_4.1s.20x7: Any blob that is not at least 2 tiles wide and high is unstable and will break apart into tar babies.
scroll.lvl_4.1s.21x7: The living tar can only be damaged on flat edges.
scroll.lvl_4.1s1e.8x16: A wise man will clear the northern room before following this corridor.
scroll.lvl_4.3s.25x10: Clear south and west passages before continuing this way to avoid redundant backtracking.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.11x6: Well now! Besides perhaps a couple of achievements, you should be finished with everything in the game.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.12x7: Please accept my most sincere congratulations, you have achieved quite a feat!
scroll.lvl_5.1s.13x8: This scroll used to urge you to play more episodes on CaravelGames.com but with this release they all are bundled into one game so you can just Change Episode from the title screen.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.14x9: Keep going!
scroll.lvl_5.1s.18x8: Sincere congratulations!
scroll.lvl_5.1s.6x8: The two bottom Roach Queens will be killed automatically once you step on the checkpoint in the far-right corner.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.7x8: Here is a small reward! Kill all the eyes without stepping on the brown grass.
scroll.lvl_5.entrance.12x23: Final words
scroll.lvl_5.entrance.15x21: New puzzles.
scroll.lvl_5.entrance.8x21: Harder versions of old puzzles.


# Speeches

# Fifth Level: 1N2W -- (9, 21)
speech.10025135: Ay, look at all those evil eyes!
speech.10025136: Ah!  It still creeps me out when one of those things wakes up!

# Fifth Level: 2N -- (2, 12)
speech.10025137: Clearing this place without any of those doors opening would be something to brag about.
speech.10025138: Ha! Sloppy dungeon design, putting in unnecessary orbs like that!

# Sixth Level: 3N -- (14, 22)
speech.10025140: Now this looks familiar...

# Sixth Level: 3W -- (24, 11)
speech.10025139: Dugan had better pay me for each of these rooms.

# Seventh Level: 1E -- (0, 1)
speech.10025141: Those eyes coulda been smote proper without any turns.  Believe it!
speech.10025142: Ha! Now that's efficiency! Wait 'til I tell the Smitemaster's Guild about that feat!

# Seventh Level: 1N1E -- (7, 19)
speech.10025146: My blade won't scrape one scratch off that squirmy fellow.
speech.10025147: But just lead him to a dead end, and I'll be rid of him.

# Seventh Level: 2N1W -- (24, 11)
speech.10025143: Jeebus!  The serpent must be about one thousand, four hundred and forty-five feet long!
speech.10025144: But my contract says I'm not obliged to deal with any monster longer than one thousand, four hundred and forty-four.
speech.10025145: Could just let this room be.

# Eighth Level: 2S2E -- (6, 19)
speech.10025152: Better be careful here... I can't get through if the tar clogs up that passage!

# Eighth Level: 3S1E -- (1, 2)
speech.10025151: I hate tar mothers.

# Eighth Level: 4S -- (3, 3)
speech.10025148: Tar mothers, too?  Why, why, why...?
speech.10025149: Every thirty turns tar mothers will make the tar grow by one tile in each direction.
speech.10025150: It is relatively safe to be surrounded by growing tar, but you have to watch out for tar babies which might spawn during the growth.

# Eighth Level: 4S3E -- (23, 22)
speech.10025158: Never mind. Let's go!

# Eighth Level: 4S3E -- (25, 22)
speech.10025153: And a wall here...
speech.10025154: Good. At this rate, we'll be done mapping the level in a few minutes.
speech.10025155: Do you hear that? It's the tar authority! We must hide!
speech.10025156: Aaargh! I almost dropped the map!
speech.10025157: Wait! Is the map facing the right way up?

# Eighth Level: 5S2E -- (1, 1)
speech.10025162: This room... it looks... familiar... somehow...
speech.10025163: It makes me feel... angry... and frustrated!

# Eighth Level: 5S3E -- (14, 13)
speech.10025159: Rats... I hope there aren't any sneaky tricks, like rooms hidden behind a secret wall somewhere!

# Eighth Level: 7S3E -- (12, 0)
speech.10025160: Oh gob... this room is gonna give me nightmares...
speech.10025161: Never again... never again...

# Mastery Level: 1S -- (5, 11)
speech.10025164: You have failed...


# Outro

outro: >
    Tar was not something Beethro expected. Or wanted to encounter. But walking
    down the stairs to the ninth floor he knows one thing - he can't smell this
    slimy substance there. But what if there is something much worse waiting
    instead?
