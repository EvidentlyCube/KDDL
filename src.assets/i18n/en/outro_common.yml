    Now that you have descended the final flight of stairs from this episode
    you have a few options ahead of you. You can strive to Master or even
    Post-Master this hold! To do that you will need to clear all the secret
    rooms and find the master wall. You will now be able to see the number of
    secrets in each level on Restore screen to aid you in your hunt. Remember
    that you only ever need to clear each secret room once ever - there is no
    need to do it all in one save. Clear them all and the master wall will drop.

    Or you can go back to the title screen, chose "Change Episode" and play
    a different hold. Or go to Caravel Games website and buy any of the
    commercial releases, download a demo to play other people's holds...
    So many options!

    The precursor of this game, Flash DROD, was an effort of many people in the
    DROD community. While I am the guy who coded it all it wouldn't have been
    possible without everyone working hard on a thing they love.
