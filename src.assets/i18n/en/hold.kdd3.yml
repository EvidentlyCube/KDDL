# Entrances

entrance.lvl_1.entrance.15x5: >
    Beethro sat down on the steps for a break. He pulled three bottles out of
    his pack. The ten-cup bottle was filled with refreshing leaf juice, and the
    other two bottles, which were in two-cup and five-cup sizes, were empty.
    Beethro wanted to drink exactly four cups of leaf juice in one uninterrupted
    gulp. He started messing around with the cups, pouring juice from one to
    another and back, but after a while gave up. "This is too much work!  Forget it!"
entrance.lvl_1.entrance.7x17: Beethro left the tutorial floor rich with new knowledge.
entrance.lvl_2.entrance.11x12: >
    As many experienced dungeon exterminators know, beneath dwell some beasties
    that are able to blend into their surroundings.
entrance.lvl_3.entrance.11x11: >
    Catching a glimpse of the room ahead, Beethro grunted in disapproval.
    "I don't know how, but the tar always ends up that way, and I hate it."
entrance.lvl_4.2n2e.13x13: Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entrance.lvl_4.entrance.13x12: >
    Again, Beethro heard loud hissing below, and knew to expect serpents. But
    this time the sound was slightly different, and he stopped a moment to
    listen and judge what lay ahead. "Good Gob! Those slitherbags must've been
    down there a gawdawful long time, with some big meals along the way."
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.13x11: |
    Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...

    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
entrance.lvl_6.entrance.8x12: Tutorial


# Scrolls

scroll.lvl_1.4n3e.5x13: The order is the key.

scroll.lvl_2.entrance.14x9: Invisibly evil spiders lurk on this level. Beware, for they are hard to see.

scroll.lvl_3.1s2e.18x7: Psst... This passage takes you to the stairs. You might want to clear all other rooms before going there!

scroll.lvl_4.1n1e.12x23: If a serpent moves west and it prefers horizontal movement, step to the east of its head to force it to move north.
scroll.lvl_4.1n1e.14x23: It works the same vertically, but then the snake prefers eastward movement.
scroll.lvl_4.entrance.24x12: Your clock tells you which direction snakes currently prefer. This will help you to control these erratic creatures.

scroll.lvl_5.1s.11x6: Getting here is a fabulous feat!
scroll.lvl_5.1s.12x7: So how did you like it? Did you manage to get all of the achievements?

scroll.lvl_6.3e.10x12: These pink-purple tiles are trapdoors and they fall if you or a mimic step off them.

    `Escape` opens up the pause menu, where you can view `General Help` to

# Eleventh Level: 1N2W -- (2, 23)
speech.10025191: Guess I spoke too soon.
speech.10025192: Looks like there's something else different about this room...
speech.10025193: Every thirty turns tar mothers will make the tar grow by one tile in each direction.
speech.10025194: It is relatively safe to be surrounded by growing tar, but you have to watch out for tar babies which might spawn during the growth.

# Eleventh Level: 2N1E -- (0, 0)
speech.10025196: Every thirty turns tar mothers will make the tar grow by one tile in each direction.
speech.10025197: It is relatively safe to be surrounded by growing tar, but you have to watch out for tar babies which might spawn during the growth.

# Eleventh Level: Entrance -- (1, 23)
speech.10025189: And I really hate it when the tar grows so high above me... gives me the creeps.
speech.10025190: Gah! The tar's grown all the way over the walls!

# Mastery Level: 1S -- (5, 11)
speech.10025222: You have failed...

# Ninth Level: 1N1E -- (1, 3)
speech.10025180: That was just nasty. Maybe tar isn't so bad after all...

# Ninth Level: 4N4E -- (17, 10)
speech.10025181: Ah-ha!  Gotta get up early in the morning to pull one over on Beethro!
speech.10025182: I am not amused.

# Ninth Level: Entrance -- (5, 19)
speech.10025184: This is a tutorial area.
speech.10025185: Visit it if you haven't played this game before.

# Ninth Level: Entrance -- (8, 3)
speech.10025183: Hot griddled roaches!  No more tar!

# Tenth Level: 2N2E -- (10, 18)
speech.10025188: A door I can't get through. I wonder what's on the other side.

# Tenth Level: 3N -- (17, 1)
speech.10025187: Hrm. This is a very strange door. I can't get through.

    undo with `%keymap.undo%`.

# Tutorial: 3E -- (2, 24)
speech.10025212: This potion will allow you to place a mimic. Mimics copy every move you make and move immediately after you, but before monsters.
speech.10025213: Place the mimic at the tile marked with a checkpoint below. Use it to drop all trapdoors and the red gate will open.

# Tutorial: 4E -- (1, 24)
speech.10025214: Serpents can't be damaged by your sword but they will shrink to death if stuck at a dead end.
speech.10025215: Remove all of the blue living tar to reach the evil eye at the top.
speech.10025216: Try to keep in mind that the tarstuff can only be damaged on flat edges and any tile which is not stable will turn into tar babies.
speech.10025217: Tar is stable when it can form a square blob of at least four tiles with its neighbours.
speech.10025218: Congratulations, you have completed this room!

# Twelfth Level: 1S2E -- (1, 1)
speech.10025201: Great galloping goblins!
speech.10025202: Look at the size of that serpent!

# Twelfth Level: Entrance -- (8, 9)

# Outro

outro: >
    If only he had a map of Dugan's Dungeon, Beethro would have known that what
    lies on the thirteenth floor is something which might defeat even the
    strongest warriors. But at least there won't be any Tar or Serpents there...
