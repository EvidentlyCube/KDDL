# Entrances

entrance.lvl_1.entrance.12x12: >
    "I probably ought to have skipped past this level, but a contract is a contract. Where'd I put those bread crumbs?" -Beethro
entrance.lvl_2.2n1e.22x11: Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entrance.lvl_2.entrance.14x11: On this level, you'll finally meet some folks with a healthy respect for your blade.
entrance.lvl_3.entrance.10x11: >
    This level is like the time you mowed the lawn and had exactly the amount
    of gas needed to finish, but then you screwed up, and had to go buy some
    more gas. And there was a big serpent at the gas station, and you wanted
    to go in to pay the attendant, but the front door was locked, so you drank
    a mimic potion to get in, and then the roaches...


    Well, I guess the metaphor breaks down.
entrance.lvl_4.entrance.15x15: These roaches need an authority figure to guide them. Someone with charisma and character. Someone like you!
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.13x12: |
    Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...

    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.24x16: Beethro ran away from the challenge like a little, scrawny kitten.
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.24x8: Proud of his achievement, but a whole lot less sane, Beethro emerged from the infamous 13th level of King Dugan's Dungeon.
entrance.lvl_6.entrance.14x9: Beethro descended into the mystical set of deadly, pointless corridors.


# Scrolls

scroll.lvl_1.2s2w.4x21: Shortcut to the entrance
scroll.lvl_1.entrance.12x3: Shortcut to the exit
scroll.lvl_1.entrance.1x13: |
    Stones lay before sand, before them lay slabs which are preceded by grass which grows on tile, on dirt built.
    -Unknown Poet
scroll.lvl_1.entrance.1x14: A true Smitemaster will not read the scroll above without conquering the level first.
scroll.lvl_2.1n3e.4x19: This fellow in the other room is not so clever. He always falls for the same old trick.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.11x6: Now that's a job well done!
scroll.lvl_5.1s.12x7: How was the game? Did you manage to get all of the achievements?
scroll.lvl_5.1s.13x8: >
    This scroll used to urge you to play more episodes on CaravelGames.com but
    with this release they all are bundled into one game so you can just Change
    Episode from the title screen.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.14x9: Rock on!
scroll.lvl_5.1s.18x8: Fabulous!
scroll.lvl_5.1s.6x8: Roach queens will be killed once you step on the checkpoint in the far-right corner.

speech.10025240: Ah, it doesn't matter.


# Outro

outro: >
    The last four floors were a real pain for Beethro with the tar, the doors,
    the roaches... As he descended the stairs he smelled more of the blue goo
    which made him cringe but in the very far back of his head something told
    him that there is even worse danger ahead of him...
