# Level Entrances
entr_21="I hope this next one doesn't have many critters.  The hands are starting to blister from all this hacking." -Beethro
entr_22=Question: You are starving to death, with no hope to find food in time.  But you do have a mimic potion.  Would you make a mimic, kill the mimic, and eat an exact copy of yourself to survive?///
///
These are the kinds of questions a dungeon exterminator must answer every working day of his life.
entr_23=You're probably the sort that uses people when it's convenient, and gets rid of them afterward.///
///
I bet you are.///
///
We'll see!
entr_24="Wow, I didn't expect to find a whole city down here.  Good deal!  Maybe they've got a restroom somewhere." -Beethro
entr_25="There better not be more than 25 levels to this place. That's plenty big enough, and all I'm down for in the contract," said Beethro as he arrived on the final level of Dugan's Dungeon.  Just a short distance in front of him was a small man holding a mallet.///
///
Beethro called out, "Hey there, little buddy! How'd you end up so deep below?"///
The man shook his mallet angrily and raced off.///
///
"Hold up! I want to talk to you!" But he didn't stop.
entr_master=Beethro descended the stairs only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...////
    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
entr_master_back=Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
