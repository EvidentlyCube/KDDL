# Entrances

entrance.lvl_1.entrance.13x13: >
    Beethro Budkin, fifth-generation professional dungeon exterminator, was
    hired by King Dugan to clear the king's multi-level dungeon of a large
    monster infestation.

    Beethro charges by the room, and as a professional, he is contract-bound to
    clear all the monsters from each and every room in the dungeon to get paid.

    The only weapon Beethro needs to do his job is a Really Big Sword, which
    will defeat almost any monster in a single hit.


    -----


    "I hope you're not going to charge me for the top level. I already have that cleaned up. Well, mostly." -King Dugan
entrance.lvl_2.entrance.13x12: >
    Beethro's a bit rusty, but the next level should get him in
    good chopping form.
entrance.lvl_3.entrance.13x12: >
    "Hmm..." pondered Beethro. "So far, I see mostly roaches down here.
    This looks like a cake job."
entrance.lvl_4.entrance.13x12: >
    "I wish I had some more of those mimics down here with me!" said
    Beethro. "It would go a lot quicker."
entrance.lvl_4.2n1e.17x18: >
    Beethro came back to finish the proper smiting business he was hired to do.
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.13x12: |
    Beethro descended the stairs, only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...

    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.7x11: |
    Beethro descended the stairs, only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...

    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.
entrance.lvl_5.entrance.18x11: |
    Beethro descended the stairs, only to find himself in an uncharted corridor...

    He won't get paid for clean-up here, but his professional honor urges him onward.

scroll.lvl_1.5n1w.9x3: This game is completely deterministic - there is no random or unpredictable behavior.
scroll.lvl_1.5n2w.4x9: |

    Look out!  It's dangerous here.

scroll.lvl_1.6n3w.20x12: Follow the sandy path to learn the backswipe technique! Remember about diagonal movement and don't turn your sword.
scroll.lvl_1.6n3w.8x9: ...then move northeast to kill it.

scroll.lvl_1.6n3w.8x15: ...then move southeast to kill it.
scroll.lvl_1.6n3w.9x16: Place yourself on the green floor and make sure the roach stands on the sand tile directly south of you...

scroll.lvl_2.1s3e.24x1: You can prevent yourself from accidentally leaving a room by hitting the '%keymap.lock%' key on your keyboard.
scroll.lvl_2.1s3e.24x2: A small lock on the minimap indicates that a room is locked.
scroll.lvl_2.2e.1x22: Roach queens always run away from Beethro; this behavior can be used to manipulate them.
scroll.lvl_2.2n.3x3: Did you know that you can hold Shift while performing any action to automatically follow it with its inverse?
scroll.lvl_2.2n.1x1: >
    `%keymap.battle%` will perform the inverse of the last action!
    Good for quickly cleaning up a horde of monsters.
scroll.lvl_2.3n.24x22: Roach queens spawn roach eggs every 30 turns (the turn after the spawn counter becomes red).
scroll.lvl_2.3n.24x21: Eggs will hatch into fully grown-up roaches 5 turns after being spawned.
scroll.lvl_2.2s3e.20x5: You can use Shift+Wait to skip until the next spawn.
scroll.lvl_2.1n1w.25x1: If you don't know it yet, Queens move away from you and don't lay eggs on open yellow gates.
scroll.lvl_2.3s3e.25x18: Also, if a queen is moving on the spawn turn, no egg will appear on the tile she has just moved from.
scroll.lvl_2.3s3e.24x21: Eggs will never appear on trapdoors, arrows, or opened yellow gates.
scroll.lvl_2.3s3e.6x2: Observe carefully what happens on the spawn turn.
scroll.lvl_4.1s.18x1: These pink-purple tiles are trapdoors and they fall if you or a mimic step off them.
scroll.lvl_4.1n.2x2: |
    Hint:

    Think hard to develop the very useful BACKSWIPING technique -- \
    good for when there's a monster on each side of you!
scroll.lvl_4.1n.8x2: |
    Hint:

    You don't need the mimic's help to fight the roaches at the entrance.
scroll.lvl_4.2e.5x12: If you have good style, all 9 mimics will be lined up to the right of you.
scroll.lvl_4.2n1e.4x20: This is a master wall. It won't open until you conquer the hold and also all of its secrets.
scroll.lvl_4.2n1e.25x6: In the original "King Dugan's Dungeon", this was a warp room which allowed you to skip a level or two.
scroll.lvl_4.2n.14x23: You might find it useful that Shift+Wait waits until the next spawn.
scroll.lvl_3.entrance.12x13: On this level you'll encounter evil eyes. Once you step in their line of sight they'll wake up and chase you like roaches do.
scroll.lvl_3.1n1w.23x4: With the invisible potion they can't see you, but they can still smell you if you get close.
scroll.lvl_3.2s1w.13x13: Here is something that I will tell you--whenever you see long and laborious paths, you should look for shortcuts.
scroll.lvl_3.2s.22x18: Turn back! Did you know that in just the last year, dungeon-related deaths were up by 32 percent?
scroll.lvl_3.2s.23x18: |
    Face the facts--dungeon exploration is NOT safe, especially when combined with intoxicants.
    -PADD (Parents Against Dungeon Deaths)
scroll.lvl_3.2n.5x23: It is possible to get to this passage without reentering the room after you've conquered it.
scroll.lvl_3.1s.16x1: The Eight Gates of Bill--a formidable puzzle indeed. It used to be a lot harder, but I can now inspect the orbs to see what they do.
scroll.lvl_3.1e.22x23: Such a long walk. It almost seems unnecessary.
scroll.lvl_3.1n1e.17x13: After stepping on a mimic potion, use your mouse or wait key to choose the tile where you want to place the mimic.
scroll.lvl_3.3n1e.11x11: |
    All of the prisoners have been eaten by dungeon roaches, and I'm next! \
    You can't pay me enough to work this job. I'm outta here!

    -Prison Warden
scroll.lvl_3.3n.6x16: I must warn you about mimics. They are neither your friends nor your enemies--they simply like to move exactly as you do. Don't turn your back on them.
scroll.lvl_3.3n.6x14: After stepping on a mimic potion, use your mouse or wait key to choose the tile where you want to place the mimic.
scroll.lvl_5.entrance.12x13: Last words!
scroll.lvl_5.entrance.24x11: Difficult, original rooms.
scroll.lvl_5.entrance.2x11: Harder versions of existing puzzles.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.18x8: Very nice, way to go!
scroll.lvl_5.1s.6x8: Roach Queens will be killed once you step on the checkpoint in the right-top corner.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.7x8: Here is a small reward! Kill all the eyes without stepping on the brown grass.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.14x9: Game on!
scroll.lvl_5.1s.13x8: This scroll used to urge you to play more episodes on CaravelGames.com but with this release they all are bundled into one game so you can just Change Episode from the title screen.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.12x7: I sincerely congratulate you and invite you to continue your journey.
scroll.lvl_5.1s.11x6: That's it. By now you have completed everything there is in this game. There may only be a couple of achievements left.

# Level 2: 1s1e (1x23)
speech.10025110: Hey, a wraithwing!
speech.10025111: All by himself too... that means I could be chasing him all over the room.
speech.10025112: Wraithwings, unlike roaches, run away from Beethro and try to keep themselves at a distance of five tiles.
speech.10025113: They are not as shy in bigger numbers, and won't hesitate to attack if they surround their prey.

# Level 2: 2e (10x23)
speech.10025109: That queen'll make tons of new roaches by the time I get to the orb and back!

# Level 2: 2s2e (24x8)
speech.10025105: Argh... too slow!
speech.10025106: Ha!  Easily.
speech.10025104: Hmmm... can I kill off those queens before they dump eggs?

# Level 2: 2s3e (20x5)
speech.10025107: I'm sure there was a cleaner way to take out these roach queens.
speech.10025108: Now THAT was a fine piece of smitemitery.

# Level 3: 1n1w (25x1)
speech.10025119: Hey, this is pretty neat!
speech.10025120: I know I coulda cleared this room without being invisible, but it was still fun.
speech.10025121: That wasn't so hard... I wonder why that potion is there?

# Level 3: 1n2w (25x1)
speech.10025123: Whew!  Now those queens won't lay their eggs unless I'm close to them!
speech.10025124: That was a bit rough, but nothing a good delver like me can't handle!
speech.10025125: Ha!  Nothing's too tough for this delver!
speech.10025122: Yikes!  I think I need the potion this time!

# Level 3: 1s (24x20)
speech.10025129: I coulda opened all the doors sooner than this.

# Level 3: 2n (4x22)
speech.10025126: No kidding.

# Level 3: 3n1e (11x13)
speech.10025130: No prisoners left? This is gonna be a lonely job with no one to talk to...

# Level 3: 3s1w (14x14)
speech.10025383: This looks dangerous... some kind of trap...
speech.10025384: Wow!  Somebody shoulda been here to see me.

# Level 4: 1n (8x17)
speech.10025114: I coulda cleared this room without going back to the entrance hallway.
speech.10025115: Beethro Budkin surmounts any challenge!

# Level 4: 1s2e (8x8)
speech.10025116: Why is it that dropping every trapdoor makes a room look better?

# Level 4: 2e (24x10)
speech.10025117: Holy Hoobuffins! Maybe there is such a thing as too many mimics!

# Level 4: 2n1e (5x22)
speech.10025118: Another secret chamber where everyone but me least expects it.

# Level 5: 1s (5x11)
speech.10025131: You have failed...
