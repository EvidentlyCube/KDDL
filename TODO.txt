BUGS:
 - Update translation files for other languages
 - Speeches on turn 0 (or turn 0 after entrance?) are not displayed nor played
 - Ep 3, duplicate chevo names at the start
 - Tutorial 2E, the voice says "you can undo up to 3 moves", but I can thankfully undo more than that. Although not sure there's much to be done about this, you probably aren't changing the voicelines

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
 - Clicking minimap maybe?
 - i18n tool - one command to update all translation files
